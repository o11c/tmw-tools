This repository contains all of the tools used by TMW data.

It was originally created by filtering the tools from the history of
the server and client data repositories, and then merging them (this repo
has two root commits).

It is a direct submodule of server data, and client data contains a symlink
that will point to the right place if it is itself a submodule.
